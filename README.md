I created a dynamic universe background using Three.js to bring a cosmic scene to life. This project features:

- **Free Planet Textures:** Utilized the free solar textures from [Solar System Scope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/) to render realistic planets.
- **Animations, Effects, and Controls:** Added animations and color-changing effects via raycasting, and incorporated orbit controls to limit zoom and enhance the interactive experience.

Check it out and explore the universe!
